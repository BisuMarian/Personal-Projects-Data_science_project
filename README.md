# Personal-Projects-Data_science_project
Recently I have also developed a more serious project using python language for my master degree regarding the efficiency of a banking envirnonment. 
The goal of this project was to train and create a statistical model in order to analyze the features of a customers sample and determine the probability of a customer to leave the bank's services. In order to achieve this goal I used unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms such as Cluster Analysis, Principal Component Analysis and Decision Trees. During this project I've expanded my knowledge involving python libraries related to data science such as matplotlib, numpy and sklearn.
