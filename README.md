# Personal-Projects-Data_science_project
Recently I have also developed a more serious project using python language for my master degree regarding the efficiency of a banking envirnonment. 
The goal of this project was to train and create a statistical model in order to analyze the features of a customers sample and determine the probability of a customer to leave the bank's services. In order to achieve this goal I used unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms such as Cluster Analysis, Principal Component Analysis and Decision Trees. To develop this project I used the following libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn

The dataset used for this project was downloaded from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers
